## Project Post Mortem

#### Approach and Process

1. What in my process and approach to this project would I do differently next time?
My process and approach is HTML and CSS to create the board and use ID as a unique number to move the players around. I might try Canvas to create the game to try different experience. Time management as i should have tackle the important things ASAP and deal/fix with the simple things later.

1. What in my process and approach to this project went well that I would repeat next time? 
TEST YOUR CODE. not the whole code but when u want to try a logic start small before u input the whole logic into the code.

#### Code and Code Design

1. What in my code and program design in the project would I do differently next time?
I might want to try canvas instead of HTML CSS. use more APIs and add AI and more players.

1. What in my code and program design in the project went well? Is there anything I would do the same next time?
i am very proud that my players piece can move smoothly without any errors when start testing and I manage to use most of what i have learn in class. Though alot of things still need to brush up. I would use the same logic again if i were to use on board games again.


#### Unit 1 Post Mortem
1. What habits did I use during this unit that helped me?
draw out my flex box and write what i want to do during the main coding.
2. What habits did I have during this unit that I can improve on?
refine search using google and brush up my basic foundation understand to attack issue. i realise most problem links back to basic.
3. How is the overall level of the course during this unit? (instruction, course materials, etc.)
I will say overall is tough, as expected from bootcamp. working and studying is not easy and the killer is always the constant homework which kills my sleep as well. But i must agree the the homework is neccessary as it really excites our brain to a certain extend.
